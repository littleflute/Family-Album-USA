[00:00.01]Episode 06: Thanksgiving  ACT III
[00:00.59]OK, everybody.
[00:02.87]I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle
[00:06.32]to Thanksgiving with us.
[00:07.86]Thank you, Dr. Stewart.
[00:09.02]Call me Philip.
[00:09.82]OK.
[00:10.84]But first, I think we should take a moment
[00:13.20]and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.
[00:15.77]Philip, I took Michelle to a school play
[00:18.44]about the first Thanksgiving.
[00:19.98]Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?
[00:22.50]Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,
[00:24.57]the first settlers in America.
[00:26.24]They shared the first harvest with the Indians
[00:28.56]and gave thanks.
[00:30.48]All right.
[00:31.47]Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.
[00:34.95]Each in his own way.
[00:36.86]Who wants to begin?
[00:38.25]I will.
[00:40.56]I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,
[00:45.19]so I can enjoy you all.
[00:46.69]All rihgt!
[00:48.11]We love you, Grandpa.
[00:51.06]I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,
[00:57.47]and for meeting Harry and Michelle.
[01:00.50]We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan
[01:02.89]and the Stewart family.
[01:04.15]I love you, Daddy.
[01:06.49]Thanks, Harry.
[01:07.30]That was very kind of you.
[01:08.83]I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.
[01:12.48]And I'd also like to thank my math teacher
[01:14.90]for giving me a passing grade.
[01:17.67]And call me, Alexandra.
[01:21.38]Oh, Robbie!
[01:22.24]She'll call.
[01:24.21]You go first, Marilyn.
[01:26.02]I'm thinking.
[01:26.83]You go first.
[01:28.79]Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.
[01:34.86]It's not finished yet.
[01:36.42]And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.
[01:40.48]Thanks, Richard.
[01:42.13]I should thank you for encouraging me
[01:44.24]to keep working on my fashion designs.
[01:46.24]I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.
[01:51.20]Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.
[01:56.09]For the food on this table.
[01:57.99]Just like the Pilgrims.
[01:59.74]I'll go along with that, Ellen.
[02:01.83]Well, help me serve, Robbie.
[02:07.52]It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.
[02:09.19]Thank you.
[02:09.99]And now to see the end of the football game.
[02:11.91]Exactly.
[02:13.76]Where are you going, Philip?
[02:15.40]Remember, the Michigan football game?
[02:17.31]And Michigan needs a touchdown.
[02:20.15]Did you forget something?
[02:21.63]Dad, your famous apple pie.
[02:24.56]Just let me see the score, Ellen.
[02:26.90]Go ahead, Philip.
[02:27.99]We should all take a little break before dessert.
[02:40.93]Oh, who could that be?
[02:44.57]Oh, it must be Alexandra.
[02:46.92]I invited her to come by for dessert.
[02:49.05]You did?
[02:50.24]I like Ellen.
[02:51.52]You know everyone, Alexandra.
[02:53.03]No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.
[02:56.51]Nice to meet you.
[02:57.46]Hi.
[02:58.63]Hello, Alexandra.
[03:00.27]Hi, Marilyn.
[03:01.10]Hi, Susan.
[03:01.77]Happy Thanksgiving.
[03:03.05]And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.
[03:05.67]Please sit down, Alexandra.
[03:08.27]Dad, Richard--Alexandra's here.
[03:12.66]Michigan needs a touchdown.
[03:13.88]Three minutes to play.
[03:15.07]Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.
[03:16.70]Hello, Alexandra.
[03:17.89]Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.
[03:19.73]One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.
[03:22.92]You want Michigan to win.
[03:24.72]How'd you guess?
[03:25.78]And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.
[03:40.86]What happened?
[03:42.53]We forgot to turn the oven on.
[03:45.45]We did?
[03:48.48]Philip, why don't you go
[03:50.35]watch the last three minutes of the game.
[03:52.46]I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.
[03:55.58]OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.
[03:59.18]Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates.
[04:01.83]And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.
[04:04.02]Sure, Ellen.
[04:08.34]How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?
[04:10.81]Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.
[04:12.77]The Molinas are a large family.
[04:14.62]I love being with them.
[04:16.49]I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.
[04:18.12]I am, too.
[04:23.40]Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!
[04:28.19]Great Thanksgiving.
[04:29.99]Lots to be thankful for.
[04:32.41]Michigan scored a touchdown.
[04:34.83]Alexandra came by.
[04:37.07]And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.
[04:41.51]Oh, Grandpa!
