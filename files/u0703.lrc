[00:00.01]Episode 07: Man's Best Friend  ACT III
[00:05.38]OK.
[00:08.17]If you want to adopt an animal,
[00:10.64]first we need to know some references.
[00:12.95]References?
[00:14.74]People we know?
[00:16.49]Friends, teachers....
[00:19.19]We need to talk to some people about you.
[00:21.56]We want to be sure that you're responsible
[00:23.83]and that you can take good care of an animal.
[00:26.58]Then you have to fill out this form
[00:28.46]about your family background.
[00:31.02]Is that it?
[00:32.24]No, there's more.
[00:34.35]We need to know about your history with animals.
[00:37.97]Have you ever owned an animal?
[00:39.53]Yes.
[00:41.09]We had a cat when I was eight years old.
[00:43.49]I love cats.
[00:45.05]Do you have any animals now?
[00:47.11]Unfortunately, no.
[00:49.40]Anything else?
[00:50.87]We also like to know
[00:52.52]your reasons for wanting an animal.
[00:54.30]Just to hold it and cuddle with it.
[00:56.82]Just to have as a pet.
[00:58.31]I love animals.
[01:01.50]To have a friend -- a pal.
[01:04.71]You know, man's best friend is his dog.
[01:08.40]And one thing more.
[01:09.62]If you're under twenty-one years of age ...
[01:11.43]That's me.
[01:12.37]Then an adult must sign for you.
[01:14.07]Uh-oh.
[01:15.69]No problem.
[01:16.95]My parents will think it's a good idea.
[01:19.32]I'll be back with them.
[01:20.55]If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma ...
[01:24.00]After forty-eight hours.
[01:25.54]But please call first.
[01:27.98]Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.
[01:31.42]It's my pleasure.
[01:32.68]Nice talking to both of you.
[01:34.29]Thanks again.
[01:35.06]Bye.
[01:37.90]Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.
[01:40.66]Her eyes look so sad.
[01:42.47]She must really miss them.
[01:44.04]I see you're both animal lovers.
[01:45.98]We are.
[01:47.18]Good-bye, Miss Aborn.
[01:48.39]We'll call in a couple of days.
[01:49.81]Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.
[01:53.06]Bye.
[02:03.70]I keep thinking about the dog -- about Gemma,
[02:06.69]alone in the animal shelter.
[02:08.54]I know.
[02:10.55]But I promise you, Alexandra,
[02:12.04]the dog is just fine.
[02:13.79]They're very kind to the animals.
[02:16.04]I know they are.
[02:16.81]I mean about her being alone.
[02:19.67]Even if they are kind to Gemma,
[02:21.18]she's still alone, without her family.
[02:24.06]Ready, folks?
[02:25.53]Are you ready, Alexandra?
[02:26.84]Yes, I'm ready.
[02:28.48]I'll have the chef's salad, please.
[02:31.39]I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,
[02:34.70]with raw onion, and french fries, please.
[02:37.87]Anything to drink?
[02:39.00]A diet cola, please.
[02:41.28]Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.
[02:43.63]I've got it.
[02:44.40]Thanks.
[02:46.85]Aren't you surprised
[02:48.02]that the animal shelter is so careful
[02:49.80]about finding homes for the animals?
[02:51.69]No, I'm not.
[02:53.72]And a cheeseburger, medium rare,
[02:55.55]with onion and french fries.
[02:57.59]And a ginger ale with lots of ice.
[03:00.83]Salad dressing?
[03:03.60]Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system
[03:05.82]when the dog scratched on the front door.
[03:08.37]Let's finish eating,
[03:09.34]and then we'll go back to my house.
[03:11.87]I want you to hear my new tapes.
[03:13.57]I've got some great new dance music.
[03:35.51]Hello.
[03:36.07]Stewart residence.
[03:37.49]Hello.
[03:37.93]Is Robbie Stewart there?
[03:39.39]This is he.
[03:40.00]Who's this?
[03:41.02]This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.
[03:43.98]It's Linda from the animal shelter.
[03:46.75]Yes, Linda.
[03:47.75]Hi.
[03:48.88]We have good news and bad news, Robbie.
[03:51.01]Oh?
[03:52.04]The good news is that the Levinsons have come by
[03:54.35]to pick up the dog.
[03:55.65]The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.
[03:59.50]That's OK.
[04:01.05]Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.
[04:03.97]I'm sure there's one for you.
[04:05.86]Thanks, Robbie.
[04:06.81]And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.
[04:10.37]Thanks, Linda.
[04:11.79]Bye.
[04:21.20]The owners claimed Gemma?
[04:23.02]That's right.
[04:24.62]I'm glad for the dog.
[04:26.89]I guess I am, too.
[04:29.18]She said if I come by,
[04:30.35]she'll help me find another dog.
[04:35.05]Come on. Let's dance.
