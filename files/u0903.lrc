[00:00.01]Episode 09: It's Up to You  ACT III
[00:08.93]I had an interview today, too.
[00:10.43]I had a great interview
[00:11.78]with Admissions at Columbia University.
[00:14.23]Really?
[00:15.16]What did they say?
[00:16.41]Will you get into the school?
[00:17.85]Well, they didn't say anything for sure.
[00:19.88]But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,
[00:23.68]I'll have no problem.
[00:25.48]Columbia's a terrific school.
[00:27.79]What are you going to do?
[00:29.12]Do? I don't know.
[00:31.47]I also applied to NYU.
[00:34.21]You sound excited about Columbia.
[00:36.52]What's your problem, Mike?
[00:38.43]Indecision. Indecision.
[00:41.05]It's not easy,
[00:41.86]and this is an important decision we have to make.
[00:44.21]What about you?
[00:45.46]How was your interview with Michigan?
[00:47.36]The interview was fine.
[00:48.97]It's a great college.
[00:50.90]It is.
[00:52.17]My father would like me to go there.
[00:54.11]He and my Grandpa both went there.
[00:56.57]Great medical school, too.
[00:58.25]I know.
[01:00.26]You can follow in your father's footsteps.
[01:02.41]Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.
[01:06.49]What do you want to study?
[01:08.26]I've been thinking.
[01:09.97]I think I want to study journalism
[01:12.29]to be a reporter--a newspaperman.
[01:14.58]You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.
[01:17.87]And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.
[01:20.34]Have you discussed it with your parents?
[01:22.40]No. But I have to.
[01:25.42]OK. Let's talk.
[01:37.24]Hi, Son. Is everything all right?
[01:41.93]Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.
[01:44.89]I was just waiting for you to get home
[01:46.64]so we could talk.
[01:47.71]Anything special you want to talk about?
[01:50.52]There is, Dad.
[01:53.19]I'm listening.
[01:55.29]Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot
[01:59.49]to save money for my college tuition.
[02:02.73]We want you to go to college, Robbie.
[02:04.31]I know. I do.
[02:06.80]But?
[02:08.79]Well, I've thought a lot about which college,
[02:13.38]and one of them is Columbia.
[02:16.21]Columbia? Why Columbia?
[02:20.51]First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.
[02:25.69]They do.
[02:27.91]And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?
[02:32.18]That's only part of it.
[02:34.44]It's complicated.
[02:38.04]I'll try to explain.
[02:40.14]Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.
[02:43.79]Yes?
[02:45.53]Well, we talked about a lot of things.
[02:48.44]He applied to Columbia,
[02:49.78]and his interview was very successful.
[02:51.86]He thinks he'll be accepted,
[02:53.23]and he really wants to go there.
[02:56.76]Dean Rafer called me today.
[03:00.04]He told me he was very impressed with you.
[03:04.06]He's a nice man.
[03:05.39]He was very kind.
[03:07.92]He told me
[03:09.85]you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.
[03:13.62]Yes. I do.
[03:15.95]I'm just not sure about what I want to do.
[03:20.09]That's OK.
[03:23.14]You understand?
[03:25.38]Let me tell you something, Robbie.
[03:28.11]Something that might be surprising to you.
[03:34.88]What? Tell me.
[03:39.48]Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.
[03:46.60]Well, I wasn't clear about my future,
[03:49.49]but I knew engineering was not for me.
[03:55.91]What did you tell Grandpa?
[03:59.25]The truth.
[04:02.84]Then you're not upset
[04:04.23]about my not wanting to go into medicine?
[04:08.30]I'm not upset at all.
[04:10.72]I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.
[04:14.97]I am too, Dad.
[04:18.26]I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.
[04:22.58]Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.
[04:28.82]I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.
[04:30.57]Well, I might want to go to Columbia.
[04:32.95]But I might not.
[04:35.30]I just want to be able to make my own decision.
[04:39.60]You're a real Stewart!
[04:42.74]And if I think about it long enough, you never know ...
[04:47.13]Never know what?
[04:48.65]If I make my own decision,
[04:51.85]I might choose Michigan.
[04:57.05]Robbie, you're something!
[04:59.18]You know, when I was your age,
[05:02.73]I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
