[00:00.35]A Place of Our Own 
[00:04.43]ACT II 
[00:18.48]I remember your parents' first house very well.
[00:22.23]It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.
[00:25.16]I grew up in that house.
[00:26.60]Yes, and you were such a cute baby.
[00:28.85]I've seen pictures of him.
[00:30.87]He had blond hair.
[00:32.94]I've been friendly with the Stewart family
[00:34.45]for a long time,
[00:35.16]so it's my pleasure
[00:36.29]to help you find a house now.
[00:37.65]Well, we're not sure we can afford one.
[00:39.92]But we'd like to find out
[00:41.22]about the possibilities.
[00:42.21]That's a good idea.
[00:44.22]I love your house on Linden Street.
[00:47.16]I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.
[00:50.12]Really? 
[00:50.68]Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then,
[00:52.75]and they needed the extra room. 
[00:54.34]I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.
[00:56.72]Mmm-hmm.
[00:57.32]So we will be needing more room. 
[00:59.59]Oh, so you don't need something immediately? 
[01:01.18]No. But in five or six months ...
[01:03.70]And time passes so quickly.
[01:05.71]Yes, it does.
[01:07.69]Well, when you called,
[01:08.60]you gave me enough information 
[01:10.03]about your salaries and your savings.
[01:12.01]So I have a good idea about your financial situation. 
[01:15.07]Let me show you some pictures of houses. 
[01:17.35]With two bedrooms? 
[01:19.19]Yes, I think I can show you some.
[01:21.19]Of course, they won't be in Riverdale.
[01:23.29]The cost of housing's too high for you here.
[01:26.90]I haven't thought about living anywhere else.
[01:29.87]We've always lived in this area.
[01:32.14]Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli? 
[01:34.48]Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco.
[01:36.40]It's a lovely area,
[01:37.57]and it's only about an hour's drive from here.
[01:40.00]Here.
[01:40.86]I have a book with photos of some homes in that area.
[01:45.41]Now, let's see. Here.
[01:51.21]This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.
[01:55.86]It's pretty,
[01:59.02]but I prefer a two-story home.
[02:01.06]I do, too.
[02:02.28]I don't care for a ranch type.
[02:04.00]OK.
[02:07.84]Oh, this is a wonderful house.
[02:10.34]I know it well.
[02:11.28]I sold it to the present owners.
[02:12.96]It looks wonderful.
[02:14.68]This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.
[02:16.80]It has a full basement,
[02:18.39]and it is on a half-acre lot.
[02:20.72]You can probably afford this one.
[02:23.63]I like this house.
[02:24.52]So do I.
[02:25.84]And the price is right. 
[02:27.69]Would you like to go see it?
[02:28.70]Yes. We're planning
[02:29.86]to talk to someone at the bank next week.
[02:32.25]Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.
[02:34.66]If someone doesn't buy it before then,
[02:36.10]But let's keep looking.
[02:40.41]Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.
[02:42.43]This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.
[02:47.13]Here.
[02:48.01]This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.
[02:51.49]Oh,
[02:52.40]I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.
[02:55.67]It looks like the houses in Hollywood.
[02:58.78]It's interesting.
[03:00.04]A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.
[03:12.83]Oh my!
[03:15.62]Here's a real buy.
[03:18.64]It's a bargain.
[03:19.44]This house just came on the market.
[03:22.14]It's quite lovely.
[03:23.06]Is it a two-bedroom house?
[03:24.82]No. It has three bedrooms and three baths.
[03:27.71]I know the house.
[03:29.05]It has a brand new kitchen. 
[03:30.47]And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.
[03:33.82]And there's a two-car garage.
[03:35.91]Then why don't we go look at this house, too? 
[03:37.70]It's a good investment.
[03:40.03]Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.
[03:41.17]Thanks so much.
[03:42.28]My pleasure.
[03:44.05]Give my best to your parents.
[03:45.97]Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.
[03:48.42]He took care of my daughter 
[03:50.87]when she was a child.
[03:53.04]He's the best pediatrician in Westchester. 
[03:53.41]Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli.
[03:54.25]I'll give them your regards.
[03:55.45]We really appreciate your advice.
[03:57.98]I do think you should go see the houses
[03:59.81]and talk to the bank.
[04:01.28]Here.
[04:01.87]Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.
[04:09.58]They're both very good buys.
[04:12.26]Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,
[04:14.67]Mrs. Martinelli.
[04:16.18]We've got a lot to talk about.
[04:17.72]Mmm-hmm. Thanks.
