[00:01.41]Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.
[00:04.23]John Marchetta.
[00:05.58]Sit down, sit down.
[00:09.20]Susan has told me a great deal about you.
[00:11.96]She says you're quite a man.
[00:13.79]She says
[00:14.31]a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.
[00:17.97]That's always nice to hear, Mr. Marchetta.
[00:20.45]Call me John.
[00:21.49]May I call you Malcolm? 
[00:24.05]Let's talk business.
[00:25.92]That's music to my ears.
[00:27.91]I understand
[00:28.62]you used to be in the construction business.
[00:30.86]Yup. Forty-three years.
[00:33.93]Here's a brief description 
[00:35.68]of forty-three years of on-the-job training.
[00:42.11]That is some history!
[00:44.84]You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.
[00:46.83]Very valuable.
[00:48.66]Thank you.
[00:50.81]Yup. Forty-three years.
[00:54.61]Half that time in my own construction company.
[00:57.08]Big jobs--factories, shopping malls.
[01:00.88]That kind of thing.
[01:02.74]Then you retired.
[01:04.20]Yes.
[01:05.86]After my wife died, 
[01:07.83]and I felt I should spend more time
[01:09.74]with my children and grandchildren. 
[01:12.89]I lived in Florida,
[01:14.39]and they lived in New York.
[01:15.99]I understand.
[01:16.80]My dautghter Cami lives in New York.
[01:19.14]I like being near her.
[01:21.91]When I came here, 
[01:22.94]I planned to take a few months off.
[01:25.99]Relax with the family and then look for some work.
[01:30.31]Put my experience on the line ...
[01:33.12]but, unfortunately, 
[01:34.53]there isn't any work for a retired person my age.
[01:37.80]Sometimes there is, 
[01:38.56]and sometimes there isn't. 
[01:40.82]Well, I'm involved with an organization, 
[01:42.90]and we're trying to resolve that problem. 
[01:46.32]What's that? 
[01:47.66]TOPS.
[01:49.08]T-O-P-S--means Talented Older People's Society.
[01:55.23]I'd like to be a member.
[01:57.12]How much are the dues? 
[01:58.35]There are no dues. 
[02:00.99]The organization serves major companies in this city. 
[02:04.34]Why?
[02:05.87]Because our members are men and women like you.
[02:08.24]Experienced, talented, retired.
[02:12.39]But our members want to go out there
[02:14.33]and use their talents. 
[02:15.73]They want to work. 
[02:18.29]That is fantastic, John!
[02:20.37]I've got an idea for you, Malcolm. 
[02:24.29]Just fill out this form for me.
[02:25.77]It'll only take a few minutes.
[02:27.38]Sit right here, 
[02:28.36]and do it while I talk to my secretary.
[02:30.37]When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory. 
[02:33.97]My company is a member of TOPS.
[02:35.61]So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you.
[02:39.39]Malcolm.
[02:40.73]And when I see an opportunity,
[02:42.10]I can act on it.
[02:44.13]Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now.
[02:50.21]Have you got time this morning 
[02:51.26]to go over to the construction site with me? 
[02:53.82]I'd like to have you meet my foreman--
[02:55.76]get some background on the job. 
[02:57.76]I've got plenty of time. 
[03:00.01]I'll be right back. 
[03:01.51]We'll go over to the job site together. 
[03:21.19]Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project? 
[03:25.49]My company was the contractor. 
[03:28.64]I built the theater there
[03:30.88]with my own two hands, practically. 
[03:32.71]I understand. 
[03:33.61]Well, 
[03:33.98]I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well
[03:37.04]because, Danny, 
[03:38.40]Malcolm is on the TOPS team.  
[03:39.53]He's going to be working with you for a while. 
[03:42.06]His experience will be valuable to both of us. 
[03:45.03]Welcome aboard, Malcolm!
[03:46.78]I'm going back to my office.
[03:48.22]Give me a call later, Malcolm. 
[03:49.64]I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting.
[03:52.71]I'd like you to meet the group.
[03:53.92]I will, John.
[03:55.10]And again--thanks.
[03:56.87]No ... thank you.
[03:59.15]And thank Susan. 
[04:03.30]He's quite a man. 
[04:04.94]A real inspiration for me. 
[04:08.29][04:07.02]OK, Danny. 
[04:10.45]I know you didn't expect to have me around, 
[04:10.97]but I think I can be of some help to you.
[04:13.58]Let me tell you something, Malcolm. 
[04:15.00]With your background and experience,
[04:16.20]I can learn something 
[04:17.45]... and I do need some advice on a difficult problem. 
[04:19.65]Let me show you this.
[04:24.65]I don't want to give you a final opinion 
[04:28.36]without studying these building plans more carefully.
[04:32.01]But a simple solution might be 
[04:35.65]to move the air-conditioning units 
[04:37.50]instead of redesigning the entire system. 
[04:40.50]It might be simpler and less expensive . 
[04:44.78]You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm. 
[04:47.86]Welcome aboard!
[04:52.76]It all happened so quickly!
[04:54.79]I can't believe it!
[04:56.53]I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.
[04:58.94]He was more than helpful. 
[05:00.36]He actually took me to meet his foreman. 
[05:03.70]I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa. 
[05:06.32]I don't know how to thank you, Susan. 
[05:09.42]You're a wonderful granddaughter. 
[05:11.74]It's good to see you so happy.
[05:13.76]I'll be at the construction site tomorrow. 
[05:16.32]What are you doing tomorrow night? 
[05:17.85]I'm not doing anything.
[05:18.80]Why? 
[05:20.24]How about a date with your grandfather? 
[05:22.18]I owe you a good steak dinner. 
[05:25.17]I'll accept. 
[05:26.80]Tomorrow night. 
[05:27.73]You and me. Dinner.
[05:29.50]What time? 
[05:31.07]I'll pick you up here at seven .
[05:32.96]Is that OK?
[05:34.26]I can't wait! 
[05:35.46]And you can tell me 
[05:36.31]all about your first full day back on the job.
[05:39.32]It's a deal!
