[00:01.82]A Real Stewart 
[00:03.45]ACT I 
[00:23.36]There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.
[00:26.73]I am so excited. Mother!
[00:28.70]Just imagine--Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled!
[00:31.93]Oh, a new baby!
[00:34.09]Max ... Max ... Max.
[00:38.78]Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy.
[00:44.12]My first grandchild.
[00:47.23]And my first nephew.
[00:50.22]Isn't he just adorable?
[00:52.93]He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.
[00:55.71]Do you think so?
[00:59.16]Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard,
[01:02.08]and I guess he looks a lot like me.
[01:05.94]Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.
[01:09.04]I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max. 
[01:13.11]When are they coming?
[01:14.14]Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today.
[01:17.72]Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes.
[01:22.11][01:20.17]The baby even looks at you like Richard does.
[01:24.34]Well, children usually resemble their parents.
[01:27.01]It's true. 
[01:28.62]Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways.
[01:31.66]And she's shy with new people, just like he is.
[01:36.27]You really like Michelle, don't you?
[01:39.21]Yes. I'm very fond of her.
[01:41.96]And Harry, too?
[01:46.43]Well ...
[01:47.47]Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh my!
[01:50.38]Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute,
[01:52.83]and we must prepare this room. 
[01:55.48]Where will we put all the presents?
[01:58.30]Well, let's take everything to the living room.
[02:01.18]Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space.
[02:04.54]It's crowded in here.
[02:08.12]The welcome sign is up:
[02:10.05]"Welcome home, Max."
[02:11.73]Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?
[02:14.28]Your first great-grandchild.
[02:17.26]Yes. Yes, sir.
[02:21.11]A great-grandchild. A great-grandson. 
[02:25.47]Another generation to carry on the Stewart name. 
[02:29.01]I love you, Grandpa.
[02:30.62]You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.
[02:35.13]One day, you'll have your own family, 
[02:37.57]and I'll be proud to be part of it.
[02:41.02]Now you understand my feelings, Susan. 
[02:44.01]I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart.
[02:48.28]He's always made me feel like his own daughter.
[02:51.30]Well,
[02:52.21]that's because you're so much like us--wonderful! 
[02:58.95]Mom, got it.
[03:05.02]This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and Richard. 
[03:07.76]They can keep a record of all of the important dates
[03:10.00]and information about Max's life here.
[03:12.83]Let's see.
[03:14.70]Name: Max Stewart.
[03:18.16]Does he have a middle name? 
[03:20.10]No, just Max. I like that.
[03:24.20]No middle name. No middle initial. 
[03:26.72]Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart. 
[03:30.50]Just Malcolm Stewart.
[03:33.20]And Max has your initials, Grandpa:
[03:35.17]Uh, it must mean something.
[03:42.70]Weight: eight pounds six ounces.
[03:46.16]Eight-six. Big boy! 
[03:49.88]All the Stewart men were big.
[03:52.05]Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces,
[03:55.05]and Richard was eight pounds three.
[03:57.74]And me?
[03:59.91]Eight pounds six. 
[04:02.58]You were big, just like Max.
[04:06.09]Eight pounds six, just like me.
[04:08.30]That's nice. Length. Length? 
[04:11.75]Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.
[04:15.60]Twenty-one inches.
[04:18.52]Is that tall or average or what? 
[04:21.28]Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.
[04:26.01]Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten.
[04:31.84]I wouldn't call that tall.
[04:35.35]I take after my mother's family.
[04:37.45]They were ... they were ... they were average. 
[04:43.14]Mother: Marilyn. Father: Richard.
[04:50.89]And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.
[04:56.24]Speaking of mother and of father
[04:59.44]--and speaking of Max--I hear the car.
[05:02.69]They're here! 
[05:03.77]Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!
[05:08.94]Let's see. Oh, welcome home.
[05:12.30]Oh, let her in.
[05:13.12]Wait with your pictures for a second. 
[05:14.50]Come on, darlings.
[05:17.10]Sweetheart .... Sit down right here. 
[05:21.79]Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!
[05:26.68]Max looks just like Grandpa. 
[05:29.04]A real Stewart.
[05:30.94]I'm so happy to be home with my family--and with Max.
