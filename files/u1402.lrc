[00:00.50]Playing Games
[00:02.25]ACT II 
[00:04.97]Oh, Daddy!
[00:06.22]We had such a good time at the aquarium.
[00:08.17]I saw a real shark.
[00:09.26]I could almost touch it.
[00:10.55]I'm so glad.
[00:12.42]Hi. Michelle,
[00:13.74]why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?
[00:15.61]Hi, Susan.
[00:16.22]Hi.
[00:17.49]I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.
[00:20.67]Hello, Audrey.
[00:21.59]Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper.
[00:22.91]I'm Susan Stewart.
[00:24.43]And this is Shirley and Nicole.
[00:26.91]Hi, girls.
[00:28.55]Come on in.
[00:29.06]Come on in, Mrs. Cooper.
[00:29.89]Come on in, everybody.
[00:30.82]The aquarium was so exciting.
[00:32.05]I had never been there before.
[00:33.70]The girls learned a great deal.
[00:35.54]Frankly, so did I.
[00:35.97]Well, please sit down
[00:38.34]and tell us all about it during lunch.
[00:40.08]We prepared some tuna fish
[00:42.07]and cheese sandwiches for lunch. 
[00:44.80]I love tuna fish.
[00:46.29]Don't you, Audrey?
[00:50.20]I remember when I used to be a Girl Scout.
[00:52.57]My mother would take us everywhere, too. 
[00:55.90]Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.
[00:58.09]Yes, I am.
[00:59.10]My company manufactures toys and games for children.
[01:01.06]Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.
[01:04.55]And the marketing of new toys and games.
[01:06.80]Can we test a new game for you, Susan? 
[01:08.98]That's an excellent idea, Michelle.
[01:10.53]I happen to have
[01:12.43]a game which I brought home to study.
[01:13.26]Let us try it!
[01:14.06]Do you want to play?
[01:15.63]Nicole? Shirley? Audrey?
[01:19.79]We tested it last week on twelve- to fifteen-year-olds,
[01:23.01]and they found it to be too easy-- 
[01:25.86]in other words ... boring.
[01:27.71]We think it might be just right for ten- to twelve-year-olds.
[01:30.83]That's us, Susan.
[01:31.95]First, you shuffle the deck 
[01:35.66]and lay them face down.
[01:39.67]Then you select the leader.
[01:41.94]I'll be the leader.
[01:44.28]The leader takes the first ten cards 
[01:47.22]and lays them face up on this stand.
[01:50.38]h-t-e-r-c-z-e-p-e-s.
[02:12.60]Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise, 
[02:15.29]left to right. 
[02:17.06]You have thirty seconds to make a word,
[02:23.02]using as many letters as possible.
[02:25.65]You get one point for each letter,
[02:28.30]plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra points.
[02:33.39]The first one to get one hundred points wins.
[02:36.35]That's easy.
[02:37.67]OK, let's go around the table.
[02:40.35]You first, Audrey.
[02:49.37]Chest--c-h-e-s-t.
[02:56.50]Good.
[02:57.75]That's five points.
[03:00.13]Next, Nicole.
[03:07.40]Three--t-h-r-e-e.
[03:14.70]OK. 
[03:15.55]That's five points also.
[03:17.71]It's your turn, Shirley.
[03:25.60]Creep--c-r-e-e-p.
[03:32.98]Creep.
[03:34.27]That's another five-letter word.
[03:36.17]Five points.
[03:36.99]So far, you're all tied.
[03:38.92]Sheet--s-h-e-e-t.
[03:41.76]Sheet is a five-letter word.
[03:46.00]Michelle, your turn.
[03:47.48]Cheese--c-h-e-e-s-e.
[03:51.87]Terrific!
[03:52.52]Michelle wins with a six-letter word,
[03:54.39]plus she gets an additional ten points 
[03:57.37]for a total of sixteen points.
[03:59.27]How are you enjoying the game so far?
[04:01.06]I think it's too easy.
[04:03.36]Too easy? 
[04:05.19]Michelle!
[04:06.31]It's OK, Harry.
[04:07.34]Michelle is quite right.
[04:08.90]She just said it's too easy.
[04:10.97]Well, I like the game.
[04:13.64]I enjoyed lunch, Susan.
[04:15.15]Thank you so much, 
[04:16.32]but we have to get going 
[04:17.65]to meet the rest of the troop at two o'clock at the museum.
[04:20.21]Oh, it was nice meeting all of you.
[04:23.04]I hope you have a wonderful time 
[04:24.62]at the Museum of Natural History.
[04:26.45]Good-bye, everybody.
[04:27.47]Have a good time.
[04:28.08]Bye.
[04:29.03]See you in front of the museum at five o'clock.
[04:29.83]Oh, OK.
[04:32.22]Thanks, Mr. Bennett.
[04:32.66]That'll be fine.
[04:33.78]And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.
[04:37.48]Good-bye, Susan.
[04:39.32]It's not a bad game.
[04:41.76]It's just ... slow.
[04:43.97]Just slow.
[04:46.49]You helped save our company a lot of money. 
[04:48.94]Bye-bye.
[04:59.65]You are wonderful with kids.
[05:03.81]I am.
[05:05.88]Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?
